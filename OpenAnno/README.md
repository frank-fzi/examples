# OpenAnno

OpenAnno is a prototypical demonstrator of a semantic annotation tool. It takes an RDF description of an entity as input and queries multiple linked data endpoints for semantic similar entities. Further, it allows to create rich annotations to link those entities based on the Web annotation model. OpenAnno is implemented in Java and employs Apache Jena.
